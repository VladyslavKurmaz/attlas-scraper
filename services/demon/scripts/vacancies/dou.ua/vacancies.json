More than 2\u00a0million out of\u00a05\u00a0million Danes read one of\u00a0Allers publications every week.

With our wide range of\u00a0weeklies and magazines we\u00a0reach a\u00a0large part of\u00a0the Danish population. Among some of\u00a0our most known publications you will find: BILLED-BLADET, SE\u00a0og\u00a0H\u00d8R, Familie Journal, Ude og\u00a0Hjemme, S\u00d8NDAG or\u00a0ELLE.

All our magazines have websites and Facebook profiles, where among other things you can read articles, blogs and participate in\u00a0contests and much more. In\u00a0these years Aller Media is\u00a0moving from traditional print to\u00a0new media platforms. We\u00a0were also the first to\u00a0put all our magazines and weeklies on\u00a0iPad and iPhone. All subscribers have free access to\u00a0the electronic versions other ones have to\u00a0pay for an\u00a0iPad and\/or iPhone access. We\u00a0need full stack developers. You will be\u00a0working on\u00a0many of\u00a0the brands belonging to\u00a0the Norwegian part of\u00a0Aller Media. Our portfolio is\u00a0based on\u00a0custom apps based on\u00a0different frameworks and Labrador CMS. You have an\u00a0awesome team with you at\u00a0our office in\u00a0Odessa, and a\u00a0set of\u00a0product owners that are really eager to\u00a0make great products, both commercial and for our users. In\u00a0terms of\u00a0technology we\u00a0have deiced to\u00a0move towards Node.js, React and\u00a0Go as\u00a0our primary stack as\u00a0we\u00a0have moved all into the Google Cloud. There are still some applications running on\u00a0PHP, but we\u00a0have a\u00a0goal of\u00a0not starting a\u00a0new project on\u00a0PHP again. The few PHP applications we\u00a0still have left are pretty new and will live for quite some time. You don\u2019t have to\u00a0be\u00a0a\u00a0wizard in\u00a0all languages, but unless you have an\u00a0open mind, willingness to\u00a0test and learn, and have a\u00a0skill to\u00a0learn new things fast, there is\u00a0a\u00a0chance you will become frustrated. And none of\u00a0us want that. The team is\u00a0responsible for all development on\u00a0several of\u00a0our brands, many of\u00a0them have several hundred thousand unique users every day! When our new services are set up\u00a0and in\u00a0production, they will still need some tender loving care and continuous development. The upside with our team is\u00a0that the portfolio has stakeholders from a\u00a0large part of\u00a0our Norwegian organization. The team we\u00a0want you to\u00a0join has an\u00a0internal credibility of\u00a0being agile, fast, friendly and fixing real problems. On\u00a0top of\u00a0this you will have the room to\u00a0widen your skillset and become an\u00a0even better developer. Because we\u00a0will challenge you! As\u00a0English is\u00a0our preferred language for communication (unless you are fluent in\u00a0Norwegian as\u00a0well) it\u00a0is\u00a0really important that you are skilled in\u00a0both written and oral English. We\u00a0have standups on\u00a0video every morning. As\u00a0a\u00a0full stack developer, we\u00a0don\u2019t expect you to\u00a0know everything about the business, but if\u00a0you can understand the issues at\u00a0hand from a\u00a0business perspective we\u00a0believe that will help you produce the best fixes for our problems and contribute with value other than just lines of\u00a0codes.
